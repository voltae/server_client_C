simple_message_server:
======================

SYNOPSIS:

   This program contains the TCP/IP message bulletin board server.

USAGE:

   simple_message_server -p -v

DESCRIPTION:

   parameters:

      -p <port> : the server port number from 1 to 65535
      -v        : verbose output of server status messages

      example:

         ./simple_message_server -p 7329

The TCP/IP message bulletin board server opens a listening socket on the given port => socket(); bind(); listen();
Every incoming connection is accepted via accept() and then a child process is forked via fork() where the external business logic
is called. (execl() call to "/usr/local/bin/simple_message_server_logic")
Because all sockets are duplicated by a fork, following socket handling must happen:
The child process closes the listening socket and the parent closes the new socket from the accept call.
